# memory-game-final

This is my memory game project done for my GA pre-work.

Being totally new to coding, I have managed to learn a lot in the recent weeks but, as expected, there are some parts that
have gone slightly over my head.

These things mainly being: 
 - getting the JavaScript to respond and turn over the cards when clicked
 - getting the board and cards to show up

I have persevered, however, and with a bit of collaboration and a lot of reading, I have managed to make this game work! 

Feel free to use this code, to work on it or to give me any pointers/re-writes/overhauls!
