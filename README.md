# memory-game-final

This is my memory game project done for my GA pre-work.
Being totally new to coding, I have managed to learn a lot in the recent weeks but, as expected, there are some parts that
have gone slightly over my head.
These things mainly being: 
 - getting the JavaScript to respond and turn over the cards when clicked
 - getting the board and cards to show up

Although the game does not work completely, it has almost all of the elements needed. I just need a little more guidance to
get it spot on!

Feel free to use this code, to work on it or to give me any pointers/re-writes/overhauls!
